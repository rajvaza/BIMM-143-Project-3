# BIMM-143-Project-3
Do the active sites in the PSEN1 gene differ in Humans, model organisms, and animals who are known to get Alzheimerâ€™s?

To see and run the final code. Go into the BIMM 143 Project 3 Folder and open up the Project 3 Final Notebook. The file should already contain all the code that has run.
You can re run the code if you clone the entire repository, and then open up the notebook. You will need all the content inside of the BIMM 143 Project 3 folder in order to run the code.
